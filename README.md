# EcoreToolsLegacy
Project which bundles the legacy Ecore Diagram editor in such a way that it can be deployed together with Ecore Tools version 3.3 (and hopefully later).

The feature uses the plugins from the Ecore Diagram Editor (legacy), which were deployed together with Eclipse Luna, but which are no longer available with Ecore Tools from version 3.x. Here we bundle them in such a way that they legacy Editor for .ecorediag still works alongside EcoreTools 3.x.
